        <h1>Python Bindings for TargetProcess</h1>
        <p>Just a note on a new project I've open sourced on Github before I go off to enjoy 
the bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p><a href='https://github.com/ash30/tpapi'>tpapi</a> is an unoffical python library for TargetProcess that exposes entity data via a standard object orientated interface and supports nested entity lookup for collections and resource attributes. 
The original motivation for tpapi was to easily explore data via the REPL
but it also comes in handy for automating those repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>As an example of what you can do, I've shared a gist for parsing a testrun. After completing
a one you'll usually have some fails that reference existing bugs and it's useful
to quickly report on any new issues. In this example I get the data for a specified testrun
and iterate over the bugs linked against failed testcases, reporting on 'new issues'
based on the homogeneity of the bug's TestCaseRuns attribute.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see tpapi allows you to navigate the links between entities quite 
intuitively and supports entity comparison and membership tests for entitiy collections.
Its still early days and there are plenty of things still waiting to be implemented,
but if anyone else wants to automate some TP dealings, feel free to give it ago.</p>
